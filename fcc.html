                    <p>For the start of our research into the Federal Communication Commission's website we decided
                        the best thing to do was to look into the site itself. We conducted a series of heuristic evaluations
                        on the website to see how accessible it was. Doing this showed us that we had a lot of opportunities
                        to fix the site we just needed to figure out which ones were most frustrating to users since our time for
                        the redesign was limited. </p>

                    <p>By giving the users tasks such as attempting to report a 911 outage, filing a TV consumer
                       complaint, and finding the guides section we were hoping to get a lot of  insight on what users 
                       found frustrating so we could try our best to fix those issues in our redesign.</p>

                    <h3>Testing Accessibility - Screen Reader</h3>
                    <p>The accessibility worked well for this. As I was navigating the site on my phone it was able to tell 
                        me where I was clicking and what I was clicking on. It was able to grab headlines as well 
                        as subtext, and told me which options were links and which options were not.

                <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                <p>Once we had an idea of what made the website hard to navigate and understand we started
                   thinking of ways to reorganize the navigation through individual card sorts. As a team we 
                   thought it would be best to do individual card sorts first so that we could see where everyone
                   thought the information should go. </p>

                <h3>Site Map</h3>
                <p>We came together as a team to make a site map after our card sorts were complete. We
                   wanted to do the individual sorts so we could find patterns from items we organized the same 
                   way and find  items that we organized in different ways. For the items we organized differently
                   we would come together  and hear why each person placed it in the spot they did and then we 
                   would make a decision as a team onwhere the item would be placed in the sitemap. </p>

                <h3>Site Map</h3>
                <p>The last thing we did before developing wireframes was creating a style tile. We wanted to 
                   make sure we were all on the same page when it came to design elements such as fonts
                   and color palettes.  </p>

                <h3>Site Map</h3>
                <p>The way this project was structured was interesting because we as a team only worked together for
                    the Research, Definition and Ideation phases. Once we hit prototyping we were tasked to do a lot of 
                    the redesign on our own. For the Wireframing and prototyping we each came up with our own designs 
                    and then would slowly start coming together. Below are the wireframes we each came up with.</p>

                <h3>My Wireframes</h3>
                <p>The goal for me was to get the layout tested. I wanted to see if this layout was easy for users
                    to scan and I wanted to see if our new navigation developed in our site maps made sense to users.
                    I tested the wireframes after making them into a clickable prototype. Users main complaints
                    since it was so low fi was having trouble with how little functionality there was on both mobile and 
                    desktop prototypes. There were some things people struggled to find so I kept that in mind when iterating.</p>

                    Dennise's because we had developed a  very loose style tile. We wanted to let everyone have creative 
                    freedom for the design choices they were making this early on. </p>

                <h3>Dennise's Wireframes</h3>
                <p>For the home screen on the desktop I wanted to try and use a color slightly less
                    dull than the orage that you can see in the mobile prototype on the left. I thought
                    the color would make the site a  little more vibrant while also drawing users attention
                    to the sections on the home screen with the color highlight at the top of each square. Through
                    testing the site again people found it easier to use and navigate and I think that is partly due to
                    the fact that there was more information present on the home page. </p>

                <p>For Allison's iteration there was a lot of changes in color and style. She also iterated by adding 
                    information in her wireframes that looks very close to what the final product of a website would 
                    look like. Like the low fidelity prototypes we were still not working together on the page layouts

                <p>Dennise went with a very simple design approach for her iterations attempting to 
                    keep the information to a minimum so the users would not get overwhelmed with
                    what the site had to offer. The feedback she received was mostly about style in terms
                    of what colors liked and didn't like. People felt as though the information was organized
                    and that the navigation was easy to use. </p>

                <p>During this phase we came back together as a team to do the final iterations for this project.
                   Because we had designed a lot of things on our own it was somewhat of a challenge trying
                   to take the best pieces of every design into one cohesive design. This took a lot of communication
                   about both feedback we've received from testing as well as feedback we received from each other. </p>

                <p>This process took a lot of collaboration on what parts of the designs were working well
                    and which items were not across our three designs. We got a lot more specific with what 
                    items we were going to use since we had come to a consensus about which direction we wanted
                    to take the design in terms of components, colors and fonts. Doing this before creating the high fidelity
                    prototypes made it much easier for us to build the wireframes since we were all on the same page. </p>

                    could make any final changes before our deadline. Some key feedback we received was there were 
                    a few glitches in the prototype with user clicking items and things not working or having to reload
                    the page entirely that we were unaware of. The good thing was that people didn't really seem to struggle
                    with navigating due to design purposes. This was because of prototyping mishaps.  </p>

                    do not feel overwhelmed by all the information this site holds. The designs are Responsive to the
                    users input and there is a search bar to access information quickly when needed. </p>

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>Information architecture can make or break a site. Communication is very important
                    when working on a project in a team. When coming together for the final design it was
                    important for us to respect each other's work while also being able to critique each other
                     for the purpose of coming up with the best design.

                <h3>Do Better</h3>
                <p>I really wish we wouldn't have spent so much time designing on our own. It made it 
                    harder to come together in the end since we each had a vision on what the design 
                    should be. We did a good job coming together in the end but I think collaborating sooner
                    could of done us good.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Colors make a difference in the usability and accessibility of a website. It is important
                    to design with accessibility in mind so you can make sure to make sites usable for
                    everyone. Information architecture is important to ensure that users can find what they
                    are looking for with ease. Using lingo in a site can frustrate users who are not very 
                    familiar with what the site is about.

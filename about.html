                Hi, I am Madeline Fisher! Some fun facts about me are that I am a graduate from the
                University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science degree in Arts and
                Entertainment Technologies, Hook'em Horns! I love the outdoors whether that be goinging
                on hikes, paddleboarding in the lake or just having a chill day at the park. I also love
                art and music and nerd out learning about it! My educational background started in Game Design
                where I specialized in Narrative Design and made a few fun projects but am looking to switch my
                career to UI/UX Design. I switched focuses because I a career that helped make peoples' lives better. 
                Thats why I have come to love UI/UX Design. I love to find ways to releave user frustrations
                by problem solving and finding solutions that impact user experiences in the best ways!

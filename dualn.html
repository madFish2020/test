                   looking at the cultural and historical significance of a place, busy travelers need a

                   and information is not all in one place so research takes longer.</p>

                   what they could improve on. This helped me understand user pain points even more and allowed me to
                   start thinking of solutions to these pain points.</p>

                   analysis and brainstorming.In order to pick the features that would be most beneficial to the user 
                   and the easiest to implement I put the ideas into a feature prioritization matrix.</p>

                    fidelity prototype that were not already in the app. Some items were just simple fixes while

                <p>Focusing your design on the user needs is key, iterating your product is interesting 
                   because your final product is nothing like the initial idea.

                    time worrying about onboarding in the beginning, so I had to play catch up when
                    developing the app functionality and the layout.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    Defining what your user needs is key, you have to compartmentalize what you think
                    someone wants to find out what they really need, user interviews help drive the process
                    of conceptualizing an app for your ideal users, iterating  is so important so you can
                    consistently improve what you aremaking even if they are small things.

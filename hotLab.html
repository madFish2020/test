                <p>We conducted a set of usability tests in the beginning to see what problems users

                <p>We wanted to talk to someone who worked at the HOT Lab Recue to learn more 
                   about what they wanted their company was about as well as what aspects of their
                   design they would like to keep in the redesign. We could not reach a person who 
                   worked there so instead our professor acted as our stakeholder. Some things 
                   mentioned where the importance of volunteers, donations and the color red. </p>

                <p>Some key problems people noticed on the site: dog profile pictures were distorted and
                   their captions were disorganized in terms of information they provided for the dogs, the
                   donation button was hard to find and it was unclear what the money was going to, and
                   lastly the adoption process page was too wordy.</p>

                   ensure that we were representing the Non-Profit the right way.</p>

                   get along with the cat they already have. Some pain points they currently face are finding purebred
                   labs from shelters in their area and having a hard time finding a dog compatible with their cat.</p>

                <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
                <p>The way we designed the general layout for the site was by first having all three of us design our own
                    home pages. We wanted to see how everyone was thinking of redesigning the site individually first so
                    everyone had the chance to share their vision. After we all shared we decided to combine the best parts
                    of all three designs into one cohesive home screen layout. Some Features we wanted to include included
                    a large hero image, a double row navigation bar and Donation and Volunteer banners.</p>

                <h3>UI Style Tile</h3>
                <p>We then designed what our buttons were going to look like as well as what the dog profiles were 
                   going to look like. We wanted to find a color palette that worked well with the color red and decided 
                   on the colors above. We also chose the hero image, the icons and the logo we wanted to use. We decided 
                    on two different fonts as well. Open Sans for body text and Rubik for headings. It was also important for us to 
                    communicate the mission of the site and site this Non-Profit is all about dogs we wanted to put the paw print
                    margin design from the old site into the new one to reiterate the focus on the dogs through
                    visual web components.</p>

                <h2>Mid-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
                <p>For this section of the prototyping we each worked on our own. Emily tackled the desktop prototype,
                    Lillian worked on the tablet prototype and I did the mobile prototype. We felt that was the best move
                    for getting the prototypes done in quick manner.</p>

                <h3>Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop Prototypes</h3>
                <p>The reason these all look different is because we decided initially to let everyone pick and choose how
                    the colors from the style guide would be used in the designs as well as we each had different thoughts
                    about how to layout the information for the hero images. I decided not to put the mission statement in
                    the hero image at all because the text would have been too crammed on the desktop version.</p>

            <div class = "user-testing">
                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>After we designed the layouts we each tested them on our own. It was interesting that we got 
                    a lot of similar feedback across the platforms. Some of the things people pointed out were that 
                    the mission statement in the desktop version was hard to read, across platforms people wanted 
                    to know if the dogs were compatible with kids or other animals, people thought the rubik font
                    was hard to read as body text, and in the mobile prototype people wanted more than just one
                    picture of the potential dog they were looking at. </p>

                <h2>High Fidelity Prortyping</h2>
                <p>For this section of the project we all came together to make sure that the designs were visually
                    cohesive by deciding how components of the site should look across platforms both in style and color.
                    We also had to decide how to layout information because we each had different methods of doing that 
                    in the previous prototypes. In all the picture sets below Desktop is on the left, Tablet is in the middle and

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>When redesigning a companies website it is important to balance user needs and 
                    stakeholder preferences when trying to redesign their site. Working on a fast paced
                    assignment makes iterations go fast so user interviews and feedback are key to making
                    improvements in a timely manner.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "do-better">
                <h3>Do Better</h3>
                <p>We did not really think about designing a mobile wireframe initially. I wish we would have
                    done that instead of designing the desktop first because it made it really hard for me to
                    shrink features when designing for mobile so that they would fit nicely. We should have
                    started small and then went big instead of doing it the other way around.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "key-takeaways">
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Understanding the stakeholders goals for the site helps when redesigning because you 
                    have a good understanding of what the company is about. Information that is not content
                    chunked becomes overwhelming for users and they most likely will not sit and read big 
                    paragraphs. Starting with desktop first makes mobile designs harder since you have to 
                    figure out how to fit all the information on a smaller screen without hindering the overall
                    design for a website.</p>
